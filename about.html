                                    <h3> Quick words about me</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>My name is Pedro, or Peter in english, as you preffer. I was born in Madrid, Spain in the late seventies, but since then i´ve been busy moving from here and there. I spent the best childhood and teenage years living and growing between Ireland, more specifically in Bray, Co. Wicklow, and Valencia, Spain. Afterwards, as my parents moved to Andorra, a small country between the norh of Spain and South of Franace, I accidentally finished working and living there for nearly a decade.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Living and growing in three different countries, with different languages and traditions, has made me the way I am today, a man of the world (that´s what I say when people ask me where i´m from). A guy with a weird irish accent that loves rugby and skiing, that celebrates St Patrick´s day with paella and a good cup of ribera del duero red wine.</p>
                                    
                                                                     
                                    <p>Currently, and for the last 14 years i´m living in Madrid, were I work full time as a healthcare teacher and researcher, that´s were the skyline photo is, and i´m happily married with  two little kids that light my days. My interests are traveling, reading, any kind of sports, spending as much time with my family as possible (incompatible with the Fab Academy, i know), and everything that has to do with new technologies<p>
                                    
                                    <p>Since little, i´ve always been fascinated to learn how things work, specially how do we as humas "work", those regarding to health sciences, I studied 4 years of Chemical Engineering in Valencia, but unfortunatelly that didn´t fulfill my personal and professional motivations (but was a life learning experience), so I moved to Madrid were I studied Phisiotherapy health degree at first, then a Master in Healthcare Research and fisihined with a PH.D in musculoskeletal pathologies. </p>

									<h3> Professional development</h3>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>I´m actually a full time profesor and researcher, in a Healthcare University Science Center in Madrid, were I work and develop my areas of expertise for the past 8 years: 
                                    <li>Technological and frugal innovation product development.</li>
                                    <li>Clinical research (musculoskeletal, neurological patient assessment).</li>
                                    <li>Academic research (probabilistic reasoning, management of uncertainty, evidence-based decision-making).</li>
                                    <li>Project development and management with systemic approach (user experience, social impact measurement).</li>
                                    </p>
                                   
                                    <p> And as for my personal skills, I enjoy multidisciplinary and international teamworking experiences, and consider myself an open minded (flexible), empathic person with high adaptability.</p>

									<h3> Fab Labs and Fab Academy</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>My affaire with FabLabs started nearly two years ago, when I was proposed to be like a link between our engineering and health care faculty, with the aim of finding how could we, in a multidisciplinary way, work and collaborate in the frontiers of knowledge to solve real health care problems. I started exploring and visiting very often our University Fablab, and soon got complete engaged. So, it was just a question of time to make the next step, that was to learn and master (as much as possible) what can be done in a FabLab, so that eventually led me to the Fab Academy <p>
                                    
									<p>Personally, i´ve got a begginers level in all the topics that i´ll work in the Fab Academy, by i´m really looking foward to see how much my capabilities and digital competences improve, and how I´ll be able to apply and share with my future students and research projects. As a health care researcher and professor being able to innovate, create and work in a multidisciplinary way it’s an unique opportunity. I´ve got the possibility to align my personal interests (digital fabrication and technology driven competences) with my professional development (healthcare innovation for goals that matter, those than can help or improve people’s lives in a sustainable and frugal way).</p>
